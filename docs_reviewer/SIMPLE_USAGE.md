```

## Use

### Just chat:

Type your messages and hit enter!

### One-off command:

That's it! No config files, no subcommands, no complexity.

## Examples

```bash
# Start a conversation
docs-reviewer

# Single message
docs-reviewer -m "What files are in this directory?"

# Review a file
docs-reviewer -m "Review example_docs.md"

# List snippets
docs-reviewer -m "Show me the code in tutorial.md"
```

python -m docs_reviewer.main init
python -m docs_reviewer.main review file.md --config config.yaml
```

```

Much simpler! The agent figures out what you want.
