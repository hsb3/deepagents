new features
* would be nice to check output of snippets too to make sure it matches, but reduce noise on things like nondeterministic output

cleanup
* reduce unnecessary configuration, added by claude at the beginning
* go back and do realtime updates for tools (custom streaming) instead of the hacky conditional logic at the moment

devx
* we want more detailed updates from the subagents themselves
